To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need administrative privileges on the DCNM application. The vulnerability exists because the SOAP API improperly handles XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing certain XML files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting malicious XML content in an API request. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read arbitrary files from the affected device.
