It is also possible the attacker could inject CLI command parameters that should not be allowed for a specific subset of local management CLI commands. The vulnerability is due to lack of proper input validation of user input for local management CLI commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and issuing a crafted form of a limited subset of local management CLI commands. An exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite an arbitrary files on disk or inject CLI command parameters that should have been disabled.
