The vulnerability is due to insufficient controls for specific memory operations. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) authentication request to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an unexpected restart of the authentication service, preventing users from successfully authenticating.
