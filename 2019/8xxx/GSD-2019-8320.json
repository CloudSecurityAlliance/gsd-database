Before making new directories or touching files (which now\ninclude path-checking code for symlinks), it would delete the target\ndestination. If that destination was hidden behind a symlink, a malicious gem\ncould delete arbitrary files on the user’s machine, presuming the attacker\ncould guess at paths. Given how frequently gem is run as sudo, and how\npredictable paths are on modern systems (/tmp, /usr, etc.), this could\nlikely lead to data loss or an unusable system.\n",
