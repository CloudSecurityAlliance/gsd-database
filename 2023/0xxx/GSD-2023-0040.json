This vulnerability was the result of insufficient validation of HTTP header field values before sending them to the network. Users are vulnerable if they pass untrusted data into HTTP header field values without prior sanitisation. Common use-cases here might be to place usernames from a database into HTTP header fields. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject new HTTP header fields, or entirely new requests, into the data stream.
