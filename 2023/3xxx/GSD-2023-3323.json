Remove the default directory permissions for \u2018Everyone\u2019 on the service grid, ABB utilities, and zenon_Projects directories and provide access only to specific users that are\nexpected to access zenon.  Install the IIoT services, which is, the Service grid component on a separate system.  Secure the ZEE600 related executable files in \u2018C:\\ProgramData\\ABB\\ABBUtilities\u2019 directory by removing the group named \u201cEveryone\u201d.
