The manipulation leads to improper access controls. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. To access a file like /assets/ a popup may request username and password. By just clicking CANCEL you will be redirected to the directory. If you visited /invoke/wm.server/connect, you'll be able to see details like internal IPs, ports, and versions. In some cases if access to /assets/ is refused, you may enter /assets/x as a wrong value, then come back to /assets/ which we will show the requested data. It appears that insufficient access control is depending on referrer header data. VDB-247158 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability. NOTE: The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
