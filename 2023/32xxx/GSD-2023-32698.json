When nfpm packaged the files (without extra config for enforcing its own permissions) files could go out with bad permissions (chmod 666 or 777).\n\n### PoC\nCreate a default nfpm structure. \n\nWithin the test folder, create 3 files named `chmod-XXX.sh`. Each script has file \npermissions set corresponding with their file names (`chmod-777.sh` = `chmod 777`). Below each \nfile and permissions can be seen.\n\n```console\n$ ls -lart test \ntotal 24\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 user group 11 May 19 13:15 chmod-777.sh\n-rw-rw-rw- 1 user group 11 May 19 13:16 chmod-666.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 5 user group 160 May 19 13:19 .\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 user group 11 May 19 13:19 chmod-664.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 10 user group 320 May 19 13:29 ..\n```\n\nBelow is the snippet nfpm configuration file of the contents of the package.
