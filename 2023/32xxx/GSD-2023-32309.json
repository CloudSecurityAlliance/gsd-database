By using the syntax `--8<--\"/etc/passwd\"` or `--8<--\"/proc/self/environ\"` the content of these files will be rendered in the generated documentation. Additionally, a path relative to a specified, allowed base path can also be used to render the content of a file outside the specified base paths: `--8<-- \"../../../../etc/passwd\"`. Within the Snippets extension, there exists a `base_path` option but the implementation is vulnerable to Directory Traversal.
