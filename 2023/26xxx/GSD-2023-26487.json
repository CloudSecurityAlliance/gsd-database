The type of the 1st argument is supposed to be an array, but it's not enforced. This makes it possible to specify any object with a `push` function as the 1st argument, `push` function can be set to any function that can be access via `event.view` (no all such functions can be exploited due to invalid context or signature, but some can, e.g. `console.log`). The issue is that`lassoAppend` doesn't enforce proper types of its arguments. This issue opens various XSS vectors, but exact impact and severity depends on the environment (e.g. Core JS `setImmediate` polyfill basically allows `eval`-like functionality). This issue was patched in 5.23.0."
