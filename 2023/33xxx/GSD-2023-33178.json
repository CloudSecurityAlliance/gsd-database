This allows an authenticated user to exfiltrate data from the Xibo database by injecting specially crafted values in to the `filter` parameter. Values allowed in the filter parameter are checked against a deny list of commands that should not be allowed, however this checking was done in a case sensitive manor and so it is possible to bypass these checks by using unusual case combinations.
