The Fides webserver API allows users to retrieve its configuration using the `GET api/v1/config` endpoint. The configuration data is filtered to suppress most sensitive configuration information before it is returned to the user, but even the filtered data contains information about the internals and the backend infrastructure, such as various settings, servers\u2019 addresses and ports and database username. This information is useful for administrative users as well as attackers, thus it should not be revealed to low-privileged users. This vulnerability allows Admin UI users with roles lower than the owner role e.g. the viewer role to retrieve the config information using the API. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.22.1`. ",
