      "details": "CubeFS is an open-source cloud-native file storage system. A security vulnerability was found in CubeFS HandlerNode in versions prior to 3.3.1 that could allow authenticated users to send maliciously-crafted requests that would crash the ObjectNode and deny other users from using it. The root cause was improper handling of incoming HTTP requests that could allow an attacker to control the ammount of memory that the ObjectNode would allocate. A malicious request could make the ObjectNode allocate more memory that the machine had available, and the attacker could exhaust memory by way of a single malicious request. An attacker would need to be authenticated in order to invoke the vulnerable code with their malicious request and have permissions to delete objects. In addition, the attacker would need to know the names of existing buckets of the CubeFS deployment - otherwise the request would be rejected before it reached the vulnerable code. As such, the most likely attacker is an inside user or an attacker that has breached the account of an existing user in the cluster. The issue has been patched in v3.3.1. There is no other mitigation besides upgrading.",

Una solicitud maliciosa podr\u00eda hacer que el ObjectNode asigne m\u00e1s memoria de la que la m\u00e1quina ten\u00eda disponible, y el atacante podr\u00eda agotar la memoria mediante una \u00fanica solicitud maliciosa. Un atacante necesitar\u00eda estar autenticado para poder invocar el c\u00f3digo vulnerable con su solicitud maliciosa y tener permisos para eliminar objetos. Adem\u00e1s, el atacante necesitar\u00eda conocer los nombres de los dep\u00f3sitos existentes de la implementaci\u00f3n de CubeFS; de lo contrario, la solicitud ser\u00eda rechazada antes de llegar al c\u00f3digo vulnerable.
