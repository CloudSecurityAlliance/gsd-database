Extracting symbolic links in particular requires resolving previously extracted links to ensure the destination directory is not escaped.\nThis is an automated ID intended to aid in discovery of potential security vulnerabilities. The actual impact and attack plausibility have not yet been proven.\nThis ID is fixed in bblfsh/bblfshd version 2.16.1 by commit 4265465b9b6fb5663c30ee43806126012066aad4.
