Extracting symbolic links in particular requires resolving previously extracted links to ensure the destination directory is not escaped.\nThis is an automated ID intended to aid in discovery of potential security vulnerabilities. The actual impact and attack plausibility have not yet been proven.\nThis ID is fixed in mholt/archiver version v4.0.0-alpha.1 by commit 10c5080fa78f78d10e28abdf11fa6d4abb7f999f.
