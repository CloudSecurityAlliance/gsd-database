In version 0.6.1, this can be exploited by simply not starting the handshake, preventing any other TLS handshakes from getting through. An attacker can lock the dashboard in a state where it is waiting for a TLS handshake from the attacker, who won't provide it. This prevents any legitimate traffic from getting to the dashboard, and can last indefinitely. Version 0.6.2 has a patch for this issue. As a workaround, do not use HTTPS mode on the open internet where anyone can connect. Instead, put a reverse proxy in front of the dashboard, and have it handle any HTTPS connections."
