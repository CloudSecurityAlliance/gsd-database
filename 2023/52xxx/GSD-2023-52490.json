It discovers that\nthe refcount of this target page is 1, preventing the offline operation, thus\nproceeding to dump the page. However, page_mapping() of the target page may\nreturn an incorrect file mapping to crash the system in dump_mapping(), since\nthe target page->mapping only saves 'anon_vma' pointer without setting\nPAGE_MAPPING_ANON flag.\n\nThere are seveval ways to fix this issue:\n(1) Setting the PAGE_MAPPING_ANON flag for target page's ->mapping when saving\n'anon_vma', but this can confuse PageAnon() for PFN walkers, since the target\npage has not built mappings yet.\n(2) Getting the page lock to call page_mapping() in __dump_page() to avoid crashing\nthe system, however, there are still some PFN walkers that call page_mapping()\nwithout holding the page lock, such as compaction.\n(3) Using target page->private field to save the 'anon_vma' pointer and 2 bits\npage state, just as page->mapping records an anonymous page, which can remove\nthe page_mapping() impact for PFN walkers and also seems a simple way.\n\nSo I choose option 3 to fix this issue, and this can also fix other potential\nissues for PFN walkers, such as compaction.",
