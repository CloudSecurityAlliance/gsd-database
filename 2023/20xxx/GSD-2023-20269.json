An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by specifying a default connection profile/tunnel group while conducting a brute force attack or while establishing a clientless SSL VPN session using valid credentials. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to achieve one or both of the following:\r\n\r \r Identify valid credentials that could then be used to establish an unauthorized remote access VPN session.\r Establish a clientless SSL VPN session (only when running Cisco ASA Software Release 9.16 or earlier).\r \r Notes:\r\n\r \r Establishing a client-based remote access VPN tunnel is not possible as these default connection profiles/tunnel groups do not and cannot have an IP address pool configured.\r This vulnerability does not allow an attacker to bypass authentication.
