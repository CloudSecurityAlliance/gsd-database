        "description": "It was originally reported that an undisclosed flaw in Microsoft Exchange Server version 2019 and possibly earlier allowed for remote code execution. Confirmation was not available at the time of the release of the original GSD identifiers (GSD-2022-1006324 and GSD-2022-1006325) however, since then, Microsoft has confirmed that these two issues can be combined to gain remote code execution (an SSRF and a Remote Code Execution via Powershell). Microsoft has assigned CVE ID's for these two issues, as such the original GSD Identifiers have been withdrawn, and the corresponding GSD ID's for the CVE ID's have been populated with data (the file you are currently reading). \n\n This issue was originally reported and also reportedly confirmed as ZDI-CAN-18333 (CVSS score of 8.8) and ZDI-CAN-18802 (CVSS score of 6.3). \n\n Microsoft now reports the following: \n\n # Summary \n\n Microsoft is investigating two reported zero-day vulnerabilities affecting Microsoft Exchange Server 2013, 2016, and 2019. The first vulnerability, identified as CVE-2022-41040, is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)  vulnerability, while the second, identified as CVE-2022-41082, allows remote code execution (RCE) when PowerShell is accessible to the attacker. \n\n At this time, Microsoft is aware of limited targeted attacks using the two vulnerabilities to get into users\u2019 systems.  In these attacks, CVE-2022-41040 can enable an authenticated attacker to remotely trigger CVE-2022-41082. It should be noted that authenticated access to the vulnerable Exchange Server is necessary to successfully exploit either of the two vulnerabilities. \n\n We are working on an accelerated timeline to release a fix. Until then, we\u2019re providing the mitigations and detection guidance below to help customers protect themselves from these attacks. \n\n Microsoft Exchange Online has detections and mitigation in place to protect customers. Microsoft is also monitoring these already deployed detections for malicious activity and will take necessary response actions to protect customers. \n\n We will continue to provide updates here to help keep customers informed. \n\n # Mitigations \n\n Mitigation information is available at https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2022/09/29/customer-guidance-for-reported-zero-day-vulnerabilities-in-microsoft-exchange-server/ \n\n # Detections \n\n Detection information is available at https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2022/09/29/customer-guidance-for-reported-zero-day-vulnerabilities-in-microsoft-exchange-server/ \n\n # Updates \n\n September 30, 2022 updates: \n\n Microsoft created a script for the URL Rewrite mitigation steps and modified step 6 in the Mitigations section. \n Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) guidance, and auditing AV exclusions to optimize detection, and blocking of the Exchange vulnerability exploitation. \n Microsoft Sentinel hunting queries \n",
