    "description": "Nextcloud desktop is the desktop sync client for Nextcloud. Versions prior to 3.6.1 would incorrectly trust invalid TLS certificates. A Man-in-the-middle attack is possible in case a user can be made running a nextcloudcmd CLI command locally. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Desktop client is upgraded to 3.6.1. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
