            "description": "### Impact\n\nVersion [0.2.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/octopoller/versions/0.2.0)\nof the octopoller gem was published containing world-writeable files. Specifically,\nthe gem was packed with files having their permissions set to `-rw-rw-rw-` (i.e.\n0666) instead of `rw-r--r--` (i.e. 0644).\n\nThis means everyone who is not the owner (Group and Public) with access to the\ninstance where this release had been installed could modify the world-writable\nfiles from this gem.\n\nMalicious code already present and running on your machine, separate from this\npackage, could modify the gem’s files and change its behavior during runtime.\n\n### Patches\n* octopoller v0.3.0\n\n### Workarounds\nUsers can use the previous version of the gem [v0.1.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/octopoller/versions/0.1.0).\nAlternatively, users can modify the file permissions manually until they are able\nto upgrade to the latest version.\n",
