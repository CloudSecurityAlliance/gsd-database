    "description": "A phishing attack was conducted against users of the Opensea.io NFT platform, resulting in 17 users losing approx. $1.7 Million USD in NFTs. This incident appears to include email phishing, a fake website, bad wallet UI that make it difficult for users to know exactly what is going on and use of the Wyvern 2.2 version Smart Contract which is being deprecated. Please note that this issue may be split into multiple GSD IDs at some point, e.g. for the bad wallet UI (you are selling something for 0 ETH which should generate a warning), lack of EIP-712 support in the Smart Contract which makes signing things more dangerous and so on.
