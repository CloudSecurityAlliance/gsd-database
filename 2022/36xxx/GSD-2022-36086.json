Prior to version 0.10.2, the heap initialization methods were missing a minimum size check for the given heap size argument.

As a workaround, ensure that the heap is only initialized with a size larger than `3 * size_of::<usize>` and that the `Heap::extend` method is only called with sizes larger than `2 * size_of::<usize>()`.
