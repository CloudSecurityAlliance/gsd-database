This vulnerability exists because malformed, encoded traffic is not properly detected. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting through an affected device to a malicious server and receiving malformed HTTP responses. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass an explicit block rule and receive traffic that should have been rejected by the device.",
