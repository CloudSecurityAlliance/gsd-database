Create a new Service Principal with a Contributor role in the Azure AD Portal.

The steps to update the configuration are provided in \u201cStep 3\u201d of the PA-VM Azure HA configuration guide - https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/vm-series/9-0/vm-series-deployment/set-up-the-vm-series-firewall-on-azure/configure-activepassive-ha-for-vm-series-firewall-on-azure.html\n\n3. Delete the old Service Principal in the Azure AD Portal that was being used in the Azure HA configuration.
