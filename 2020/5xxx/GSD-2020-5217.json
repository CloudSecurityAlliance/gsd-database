Duplicate directives are ignored\nand the first one wins. The directives in secure_headers are sorted alphabetically so they\npretty much all come before script-src. A previously undefined directive would receive a value\neven if SecureHeaders::OPT_OUT was supplied.\n\nThe fixed versions will silently convert the semicolons to spaces and emit a deprecation warning\nwhen this happens. This will result in innocuous browser console messages if being\nexploited/accidentally used. In future releases, we will raise application errors resulting in\n500s.\n\n> Duplicate script-src directives detected. All but the first instance will be ignored.\n\nSee https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP3/#parse-serialized-policy\n\n> Note: In this case, the user agent SHOULD notify developers that a duplicate directive was\n> ignored. A console warning might be appropriate, for example.\n\n# Workarounds\n\nIf you are passing user input into the above methods, you could filter out the input:\n\n```\noverride_content_security_policy_directives(:frame_src, [user_input.gsub(\";\", \" \")])\n```",
