NOTE: The vendor argue that this CVE is not a vulnerability because it has an inaccurate bug scope and patch links. \u201c1) Inaccurate Bug Scope - The issue scope was on Kong's docker-compose template, and not Kong's docker image itself. In reality, this issue is not associated with any version of the Kong gateway.

El puerto API de administrador puede ser accesible en interfaces que no sean 127.0.0.1. NOTA: El proveedor argumenta que este CVE no es una vulnerabilidad porque tiene un alcance de error y enlaces de parche imprecisos. \u201c1) Alcance de error inexacto: el alcance del problema estaba en la plantilla de compilaci\u00f3n de acoplador de Kong, y no en la imagen de acoplador de Kong en s\u00ed. En realidad, este problema no est\u00e1 asociado con ninguna versi\u00f3n de la puerta de enlace Kong. Como tal, la descripci\u00f3n que indica \"Se descubri\u00f3 un problema en docker-kong (para Kong) a trav\u00e9s de 2.0.3.\" Es incorrecta. Este problema solo ocurre si un usuario decidi\u00f3 girar Kong a trav\u00e9s de Docker-compose sin seguir la documentaci\u00f3n de seguridad. La plantilla Docker-compose est\u00e1 dise\u00f1ada para que los usuarios comiencen r\u00e1pidamente con Kong, y solo para fines de desarrollo. 2) Enlaces de parches incorrectos: el CVE actualmente apunta a una mejora de la documentaci\u00f3n como un enlace de \"Parche\": https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/commit/d693827c32144943a2f45abc017c1321b33ff611 Este enlace en realidad apunta a una mejora que Kong Inc hizo para la prueba de tontos. Sin embargo, las instrucciones sobre c\u00f3mo proteger la API de administraci\u00f3n ya estaban bien documentadas aqu\u00ed: https://docs.konghq.com/2.0.x/secure-admin-api/#network-layer-access-restrictions, que se public\u00f3 por primera vez en 2017 (como se muestra en esta confirmaci\u00f3n: https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/commit/e99cf875d875dd84fdb751079ac37882c9972949) Por \u00faltimo, el hiperv\u00ednculo a https://github.com/Kong/kong (un repositorio de Github no relacionado con este problema) en la lista de hiperv\u00ednculos no incluye ninguna informaci\u00f3n significativa sobre este tema \"."
