This allows a compromised host in a protected network to evade any security policy that uses URL filtering on a firewall configured with SSL Decryption in the Forward Proxy mode. A malicious actor can then use this technique to evade detection of communication on the TLS handshake phase between a compromised host and a remote malicious server. This technique does not increase the risk of a host being compromised in the network. It does not impact the confidentiality or availability of a firewall. This is considered to have a low impact on the integrity of the firewall because the firewall fails to enforce a policy on certain traffic that should have been blocked.

To enforce URL filtering policy on TLS handshakes for decrypted HTTPS sessions, we suggest you use any one of the following workarounds:\n\n1. Route outbound traffic between two virtual systems (vsys) on PAN-OS firewalls that have vsys capability and perform URL Filtering on one vsys and perform SSL/TLS Decryption on the other vsys.\n\n2. Add two additional Security Zones and route outbound traffic between the two zones so that you can apply both \"Decrypt\" and \"No Decrypt\" Decryption policy rules. For example, configure your next-generation firewall so that traffic travels from the Inside zone to the Internal-DMZ zone where you applied a \u201cNo Decrypt\u201d rule along with URL Filtering and then the traffic passes to the External-DMZ zone and from External-DMZ to the Internet zone where you applied a \"Decrypt\" rule. Be aware that this workaround configuration may significantly increase the load on your firewall.\n\n3. Use the additional security device in the traffic chain. \nThe SSL/TLS Decryption and URL Filtering functions should be separated (for example, the first device is performing URL Filtering and the second device is performing SSL/TLS Decryption).\n\nThese workarounds are described in detail at https://knowledgebase.paloaltonetworks.com/KCSArticleDetail?id=kA14u0000008V4J\n\nWe recommend you use an endpoint protection solution such as the Cortex XDR agent to significantly reduce the potential risk of hosts being compromised. See https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/endpoint-protection.\n\nCaution: We recommend that you do not disable SSL/TLS Decryption as a workaround to this issue. There are additional risks associated with this action. \n"
