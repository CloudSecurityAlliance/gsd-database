Supported versions that are affected are 7.0.0.0.0 and  12.2.1.4.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition.  Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition, attacks may significantly impact additional products (scope change). Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in  unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition accessible data as well as  unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition accessible data.
