An unauthenticated attacker can then attempt to access such a file by sending a specific request to the device trying to guess the name of such a file. Successful exploitation will reveal configuration information.\n\nThis issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series and EX Series:\n  *  All versions earlier than 20.4R3-S9;\n  *  21.2 versions earlier than 21.2R3-S7;\n  *  21.3 versions earlier than 21.3R3-S5;\n  *  21.4 versions earlier than 21.4R3-S6;\n  *  22.1 versions earlier than 22.1R3-S5;\n  *  22.2 versions earlier than 22.2R3-S3;\n  *  22.3 versions earlier than 22.3R3-S2;\n  *  22.4 versions earlier than 22.4R3;\n  *  23.2 versions earlier than 23.2R1-S2, 23.2R2.\n\n\n",
