Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle iSupport.  Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle iSupport, attacks may significantly impact additional products (scope change). Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in  unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle iSupport accessible data as well as  unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle iSupport accessible data.
