Supported versions that are affected are 11.5, 12.1 and  12.2. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Complex Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul.  Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle Complex Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul, attacks may significantly impact additional products (scope change). Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in  unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Complex Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul accessible data as well as  unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle Complex Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul accessible data.
