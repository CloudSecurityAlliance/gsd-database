Easily exploitable vulnerability allows high privileged attacker with network access via ICMP to compromise Integrated Lights Out Manager (ILOM).  Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Integrated Lights Out Manager (ILOM), attacks may significantly impact additional products (scope change). Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in  unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Integrated Lights Out Manager (ILOM) accessible data as well as  unauthorized read access to a subset of Integrated Lights Out Manager (ILOM) accessible data.
