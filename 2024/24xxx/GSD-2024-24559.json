Concretely, the `height` variable is miscalculated. The vulnerability can't be triggered without writing the `IR` by hand (that is, it cannot be triggered from regular vyper code). `sha3_64` is used for retrieval in mappings. No flow that would cache the `key` was found so the issue shouldn't be possible to trigger when compiling the compiler-generated `IR`. This issue isn't triggered during normal compilation of vyper code so the impact is low. At the time of publication there is no patch available.",
