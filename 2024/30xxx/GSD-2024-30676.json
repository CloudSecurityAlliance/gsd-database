A malicious user could potentially exploit this vulnerability remotely to crash the ROS2 nodes, thereby causing a denial of service. The flaw allows an attacker to cause unexpected behavior in the operation of ROS2 nodes, which leads to their failure and interrupts the regular operation of the system, thus making it unavailable for its intended users."
