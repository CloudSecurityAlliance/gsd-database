When negotiated write size is not a\nmultiple of 4096 the netfs code can skip the end of the final\npage when doing large sequential writes, causing data corruption.\n\nThis section of code is being rewritten/removed due to a large\nnetfs change, but until that point (ie for the 6.3 kernel until now)\nwe can not support non-standard maximum write sizes.\n\nAdd a warning if a user specifies a wsize on mount that is not\na multiple of 4096 (and round down), also add a change where we\nround down the maximum write size if the server negotiates a value\nthat is not a multiple of 4096 (we also have to check to make sure that\nwe do not round it down to zero).",
