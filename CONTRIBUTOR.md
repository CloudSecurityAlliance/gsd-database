# Contributing to the GSD database (gsd-database)

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug, problem, typo, error or any other sort of issue
- Discussing the current state of the data, documentation, tools or code
- Submitting a fix, update, correction, deletion, confirmation, clarification or anything else
- Proposing new features, use cases, tooling, data types, everything
- Becoming a contributor, maintainer or whatever level of involvement you're comfortable with

Please note that the gsd-database repo is the data, if you want to contribute tools that are experimental please go to the [gsd-experimental](https://github.com/cloudsecurityalliance/gsd-experimental) repo or the tools that are more mature in the [gsd-tools](https://github.com/cloudsecurityalliance/gsd-tools) repo.

## We Develop with Github

We currently use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We also communicate in other ways

The CSA Circle Community is available at https://csaurl.org/circle-gsd

There is also a mailing list at https://csaurl.org/list-gsd

## We Use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Ensure the test suite passes (we don't have one yet).
3. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make to the gsd-database will be under the Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal License
In short, when you submit data changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal License](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report problems or bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/cloudsecurityalliance/gsd-database/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with as much detail as possible, but don't worry if it's not perfect

The gsd-database is data so a bug report of "GSD-YEAR-INT description doesn't sound quite right but I'm not sure exactly what's wrong" is still better than nobody speaking up. We need to figure out some examples and guidance on writing good bug reports for this so it's a TODO for now.

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Data Schema

Currently the GSD namespace does not have an official data schema, but we do generally use the OSV format. Feel free to use the OSV format, CVE format, or whichever format you prefer, and please add a "data_type" tag if the data doesn't have one to make parsing easier.
