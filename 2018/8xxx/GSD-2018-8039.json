When this system property is set, CXF uses some reflection to try to make the `HostnameVerifier` work with the old `com.sun.net.ssl.HostnameVerifier` interface. However, the default `HostnameVerifier` implementation in CXF does not implement the method in this interface, and an exception is thrown. However, in Apache CXF prior the exception is caught in the reflection code and not properly propagated.
