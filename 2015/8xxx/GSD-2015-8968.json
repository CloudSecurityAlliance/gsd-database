Normally git never requests URLs that the user doesn't\nspecifically request, so this is not a serious security concern. However,\nsubmodules did allow the remote repository to specify what URL to clone\nfrom.\n\nIf an attacker can instruct a user to run a recursive clone from a\nrepository they control, they can get a client to run an arbitrary shell\ncommand. Alternately, if an attacker can MITM an unencrypted git clone,\nthey could exploit this. The ext command will be run if the repository is\nrecursively cloned or if submodules are updated. This attack works when\ncloning both local and remote repositories.\n",
