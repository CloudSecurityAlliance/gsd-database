Before that, you should open the browser\ndev tools and change the `type` attribute for that field from `email` to `text`.\nAfter entering a fake address and pressing the \"Save & Continue\" button, the\nbrowser will take a long term to perform the request before showing an error\nmessage for the invalid address. Eventually, making the email string even longer\ncould lead to the exhaustion of server resources.\n\n### Patches\nVersions 3.1.4, 3.0.4, and 2.11.13 have been patched to use a different regular\nexpression.\n\nThere's an improbable chance that some orders in your system end up having\nassociated an email address that is no longer valid. We've added a task to check\nprecisely that:\n\n```bash\nbin/rails solidus:check_orders_with_invalid_email\n```\n\nThe above will print information for every affected order if any.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf a prompt upgrade is not an option, please, add the following to\n`config/application.rb`:\n\n```ruby\nconfig.after_initialize do\n  Spree::EmailValidator.send(:remove_const, :EMAIL_REGEXP)\n  Spree::EmailValidator::EMAIL_REGEXP = URI::MailTo::EMAIL_REGEXP\nend\n```\n",
