    "description": "SonicWall is aware of improper neutralization of a SQL Command leading to SQL Injection vulnerability, reported by CrowdStrike, impacting end-of-life Secure Remote Access (SRA) products, specifically the SRA appliances running all 8.x firmware or an old version of firmware 9.x (9.0.0.9-26sv or earlier). In February 2021, SonicWall released SMA firmware 10.2.0.7 and 9.0.0.10 to fix a zero-day vulnerability, along with additional comprehensive code-strengthening. This strengthening proactively prevented this newly reported vulnerability in 9.0.0.10. Organizations that already upgraded to the 9.0.0.10 firmware are already protected against this newly reported issue and don\u2019t need to take any action. Organizations with any 10.x version is not subject to this vulnerability as the vulnerable feature was deprecated in the 10.x release. Organizations running any firmware versions of 8.x or older than 9.0.0.10 or 10.2.0.7 should, per our earlier instructions, upgrade immediately. These older versions may potentially be exploited if not patched immediately. SMA 1000 Series products are not affected by this vulnerability. "
