And then super block will be reread\nagain but using correct blocksize this time. sb_set_blocksize() didn't\nfully free superblock page and buffer head, and being busy, they were\nnot freed and instead leaked.\n\nThis can easily be reproduced by calling an infinite loop of:\n\n  systemctl start <ext4_on_lvm>.mount, and\n  systemctl stop <ext4_on_lvm>.mount\n\n... since systemd creates a cgroup for each slice which it mounts, and\nthe bh leak get amplified by a dying memory cgroup that also never\ngets freed, and memory consumption is much more easily noticed."
