His analysis, however,\nmisses the real root cause and it cannot be seen from the crash\nbacktrace only, as the real offender is tg_unthrottle_up() getting\ncalled via sched_cfs_period_timer() via the timer interrupt at an\ninconvenient time.\n\nWhen unregister_fair_sched_group() unlinks all cfs_rq's from the dying\ntask group, it doesn't protect itself from getting interrupted. If the\ntimer interrupt triggers while we iterate over all CPUs or after\nunregister_fair_sched_group() has finished but prior to unlinking the\ntask group, sched_cfs_period_timer() will execute and walk the list of\ntask groups, trying to unthrottle cfs_rq's, i.e. re-add them to the\ndying task group. These will later -- in free_fair_sched_group() -- be\nkfree()'ed while still being linked, leading to the fireworks Kevin\nand Michal are seeing.\n\nTo fix this race, ensure the dying task group gets unlinked first.\nHowever, simply switching the order of unregistering and unlinking the\ntask group isn't sufficient, as concurrent RCU walkers might still see\nit, as can be seen below:\n\n    CPU1:                                      CPU2:\n      :                                        timer IRQ:\n      :                                          do_sched_cfs_period_timer():\n      :                                            :\n      :                                            distribute_cfs_runtime():\n      :                                              rcu_read_lock();\n      :                                              :\n      :                                              unthrottle_cfs_rq():\n    sched_offline_group():                             :\n      :                                                walk_tg_tree_from(\u2026,tg_unthrottle_up,\u2026):\n      list_del_rcu(&tg->list);                           :\n (1)  :                                                  list_for_each_entry_rcu(child, &parent->children, siblings)\n      :                                                    :\n (2)  list_del_rcu(&tg->siblings);                         :\n      :                                                    tg_unthrottle_up():\n      unregister_fair_sched_group():                         struct cfs_rq *cfs_rq = tg->cfs_rq[cpu_of(rq)];\n        :                                                    :\n        list_del_leaf_cfs_rq(tg->cfs_rq[cpu]);               :\n        :                                                    :\n        :                                                    if (!cfs_rq_is_decayed(cfs_rq) || cfs_rq->nr_running)\n (3)    :                                                        list_add_leaf_cfs_rq(cfs_rq);\n      :                                                      :\n      :                                                    :\n      :                                                  :\n      :                                                :\n      :                           \n---truncated---"
