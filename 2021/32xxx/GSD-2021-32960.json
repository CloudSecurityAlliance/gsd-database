Information on Setting up Windows Event Logs is available at Knowledgebase Article QA5965\n\nRockwell Automation recommends the following general security guidelines:\nRun all software as User, not as an Administrator, to minimize the impact of malicious code on the infected system.\nEnsure the least-privilege user principle is followed, and user/service account access to shared resources (such as a database) is only granted with a minimum number of rights as needed.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nPlease see the Rockwell Automation publication regarding this issue for more information."
