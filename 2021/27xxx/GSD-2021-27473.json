Employ training and awareness programs to educate users on the warning signs of a phishing or social engineering attack.\n    Use of Microsoft AppLocker or other similar allow list applications can help mitigate risk. Information on using AppLocker with Rockwell Automation products is available at KnowledgeBase Article QA17329 (login required).\n    Ensure the least-privilege user principle is followed, and user/service account access to shared resources (such as a database) is only granted with a minimum number of rights as needed.\n\nFor more information, please see the industrial security advisory from Rockwell Automation.
