        "description": "This vulnerability was not correctly fixed \"in certain non-default configuration\" and a new vulnerability and patch have been released, please see GSD-2021-1002353 (CVE-2021-45046). Apache Log4j2 <=2.14.1 JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default. \n\n In log4j 2.15.1 and later JNDI will be disabled by default: \n\n \"Dealing with CVE-2021-44228 has shown the JNDI has significant security issues. While we have mitigated what we are aware of it would be safer for users to completely disable it by default, especially since the large majority are unlikely to be using it. Those who are will need to specify -Dlog4j2.enableJndi=true or the environment variable form of it to use any JNDI components.\" (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-3208) \n\n In previous releases (>2.10) this behavior can be mitigated by setting system property \"log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups\" to \"true\" or by removing the JndiLookup class from the classpath (example: zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class). Java 8u121 (see https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/8u121-relnotes.html) protects against remote code execution by defaulting \"com.sun.jndi.rmi.object.trustURLCodebase\" and \"com.sun.jndi.cosnaming.object.trustURLCodebase\" to \"false\". \n\n Later versions of the Oracle Java JDK are not affected by the LDAP attack vector, but other vectors are available for exploitation: \"JDK versions greater than 6u211, 7u201, 8u191, and 11.0.1 are not affected by the LDAP attack vector but please note this still leaves other attack vectors. In these versions com.sun.jndi.ldap.object.trustURLCodebase is set to \"false\" meaning JNDI cannot load remote code using LDAP.\" (https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day/) \n\n Also please note that log4j version 1.x is not affected by this specific vulnerability it does have a number of known serious security flaws and likely also contains Remote Code Execution vulnerabilities, upgrading it should be investigated. \n\n Hot patches: \n\n There are currently several projects providing hot patches that can modify a running system to remove the vulnerability and are OpenSource licensed allowing them to be easily audited: \n\n Log4jHotPatch \n\n This is a tool which injects a Java agent into a running JVM process. The agent will attempt to patch the lookup() method of all loaded org.apache.logging.log4j.core.lookup.JndiLookup instances to unconditionally return the string \"Patched JndiLookup::lookup()\". It is designed to address the CVE-2021-44228 remote code execution vulnerability in Log4j without restarting the Java process. The dynamic and static agents are known to run on JDK 8 & 11 on Linux whereas on JDK 17 only the static agent is working (see below)\" (https://github.com/corretto/hotpatch-for-apache-log4j2) \n\n Logout4Shell \n\n \"However, enabling these system property requires access to the vulnerable servers as well as a restart. The Cybereason research team has developed the following code that exploits the same vulnerability and the payload therein forces the logger to reconfigure itself with the vulnerable setting disabled - this effectively blocks any further attempt to exploit Log4Shell on this server.\" (https://github.com/Cybereason/Logout4Shell) \n\n Detection \n\n Please see the GSD reference links tagged with \"DETECTION\" for more information (there are to many to list here). \n\n TOP LINKS: \n\n Best list of vulnerable software: https://github.com/NCSC-NL/log4shell/tree/main/software\n\n Best list of vulnerable services: https://github.com/YfryTchsGD/Log4jAttackSurface \n\n Best hotpatch:\n\n https://github.com/corretto/hotpatch-for-apache-log4j2 \n\n Best detection:\n\n grep: https://gist.github.com/Neo23x0/e4c8b03ff8cdf1fa63b7d15db6e3860b\n\n jarhashes: https://github.com/mubix/CVE-2021-44228-Log4Shell-Hashes \n\n semgrep: https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep-rules/pull/1650/commits/ecfc32623eec718d61ec83b9196574f333191008/\n\n yara: https://github.com/timb-machine/log4j/\n\n burpsuite: https://github.com/silentsignal/burp-log4shell \n\n Nmap NSE: https://github.com/Diverto/nse-log4shell\n\n Scanners: \n https://github.com/alexbakker/log4shell-tools\n https://github.com/fullhunt/log4j-scan\n https://github.com/takito1812/log4j-detect\n\nExploitation: \n\n An exploit kit is available at https://github.com/pimps/JNDI-Exploit-Kit and it has also been reported that omitting the closing } can result in data from other requests being sent as some servers with log4j2 will apparently keep sending data until they find a closing }.",

As we will demo during the talk, attackers will be able to use different techniques to run arbitrary code on the server performing JNDI lookups.\n\nThe talk will first present the basics of this new vulnerability including the underlying technology, and will then explain in depth the different ways an attacker can exploit it using different vectors and services. We will focus on exploiting RMI, LDAP and CORBA services as these are present in almost every Enterprise application.\n\nLDAP offers an alternative attack vector where attackers not able to influence the address of an LDAP lookup operation may still be able to modify the LDAP directory in order to store objects that will execute arbitrary code upon retrieval by the application lookup operation. This may be exploited through LDAP manipulation or simply by modifying LDAP entries as some Enterprise directories allow.",

The official security advisory from Apache can be found here: https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html\n\n Entrust has investigated the impact of CVE-2021-44228 in all of our hosted services. Entrust is continuing to monitor and asses ongoing product impacts and will perform additional actions as necessary. Product-specific details known at the time of writing are below.\n\n Impact of Vulnerability:\n\n Entrust Certificate Services:\n Entrust Certificate Services has sufficiently strong network controls to prevent direct exploitation. Additionally, Entrust has performed mitigations consistent with the Apache Log4j advisory. Note that the on-premise Discovery Agent component is affected, and is covered in Entrust Security Bulletin E21-008. Discovery Agent is out of support and superseded by Entrust Discovery Scanner, which is not affected.\n\n PKI as a Service (PKIaaS):\n Entrust has performed mitigations on PKI as a Service (PKIaaS) consistent with the Apache Log4j advisory, and additionally is applying product patches to update Log4j to version 2.15 or later. \n\n Remote Signing Service:\n Remote Signing Service has sufficiently strong network controls and has incoming data validation that prevent direct exploitation. Entrust is applying product patches to update Log4j to version 2.15 or later. \n\n Signing Automation Service:\n Entrust has performed mitigations for Signing Automation Service consistent with the Apache Log4j advisory, and additionally will apply product patches to update Log4j to version 2.15 as the patches become available.\n\n Ongoing Mitigating Efforts:\n Entrust is monitoring our hosted services for exploit attempts related to this vulnerability, and will take additional action as necessary. For all environments listed above, Entrust has initiated a review and mitigation process with its vendors supplying 3rd party products used in these environments, and will take actions as necessary.\n\n Corrective Action:\n No customer action is required at this time. Further information will be communicated in product-specific bulletins as necessary.",

An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From log4j, this behavior has been disabled by default. In previous releases (>2.10) this behavior can be mitigated by setting system property `log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups` to `true` or it can be mitigated in prior releases (<2.10) by removing the JndiLookup class from the classpath (example, `zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class`).",

An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled.
