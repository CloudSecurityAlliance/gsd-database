    "notes": "It appears that there is no actual malware/ad fraud going on with DroidScript, however removal of this software from the Google Play Store will at a minimum cause problems with the apps using it and will cause the DroidScript ecosystem to go stale (can't update it), hence the identifier as future updates will not be possible.",
    "description": "DroidScript, all versions, were removed from the Google store after allegations of malware and ad fraud surfaced from Google. It is reported that ad clicking activity did take place but that it was not as a direct result from DriodScript themselves. However due to the removal of DroidScript it is unlikely that many DroidScript based applications will receive  security updates, creating a significant vulnerability (effectively an update freeze attack)."
