This vulnerability exists because `swagger-ui` automatically executes external Javascript that is loaded in via the `url` query string parameter when a `Content-Type: application/javascript` header is included.\n\nAn attacker can create a server that replies with a malicious script and the proper content-type, and then craft a `swagger-ui` URL that includes the location to their server/script in the `url` query string parameter. When viewed, such a link would execute the attacker's malicious script.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to 2.2.1 or later.",
