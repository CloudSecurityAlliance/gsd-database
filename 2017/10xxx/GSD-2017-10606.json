Updating TPM firmware requires one of the following software releases: Junos OS 15.1X49-D111, 17.4R1, or any subsequent release.\n\nNote: Junos OS 17.3 is unaffected by this issue since TPM functionality is not supported in this release.\n\nThe TPM firmware is then updated via a special \"jtpm\" package available for download along with the updated Junos OS package.  After upgrading to a fixed release above, execute the following command to update the TPM firmware:\n\n  user@junos> request system software add jtpm-15.1X49-D111-signed.tgz\n\nWhen the TPM firmware is updated, the log message \"TPM firmware updated successfully.\" will appear on the screen.  After updating the TPM firmware, reboot the system using the \u2018request system reboot\u2019 command.\n \nOnce system reboots, verify TPM status using the \u2018show security tpm status\u2019 command.  The TPM Firmware revision should show as 4.43 instead of 4.40.\n\n\nThis issue is being tracked as PR 1293114 and is visible on the Customer Support website.",
