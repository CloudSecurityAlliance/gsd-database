# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

All data in the repository in entries under the GSD namespace is supported by the GSD project.

Data in other namespaces are partially supported in the sense that the GSD Project can post updated or corrected information, but to correct the data within that namespace you will need to work with the namespace owner (who may for example have a policy that allows anyone to correct anything, or may require that only the namespace owner can change it for example).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please file an issue and use the keyword "security" in the title if it is not serious.

If you feel it is serious and want to report it privately please email security@gsd.id.

Please note that as a volunteer driven project response times may vary.
