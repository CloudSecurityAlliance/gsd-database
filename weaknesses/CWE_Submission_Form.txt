Please use this form to submit new content to the Common Weakness Enumeration. All new content submissions must adhere to the Terms of Use (see below). In addition to the instructions provided below, please review the Guidelines for New Content Submission located on the CWE website. (https://cwe.mitre.org/community/submissions/guidelines.html)

This form is meant as a starting point to submit fundamental weakness information to the CWE corpus. This form does not cover all potential CWE fields that may be required before publication, and additional conversations with the CWE team will likely be necessary. For a complete list of information fields available, please review the CWE Schema. (https://cwe.mitre.org/documents/schema/)

PROCESS
-------------
1) Ensure the following before submitting content:
	
	a. Information is Public. The submitted information, if included within CWE, will become public information. Ensure that the information has been approved for public release by the appropriate authority.

	b. Conformance to Guidelines. It is your option regarding how closely you want to conform with these guidelines. However, submissions that do not follow these guidelines may take longer to integrate into CWE, or they may be modified heavily. Generally, MITRE may choose to deprioritize non-conformant submissions.

	c. Abstraction. Consider whether the submission is at an appropriate level of abstraction that is represented within CWE. Guidelines are not well-defined as of this time, but be familiar with Classes, Bases, and Variants (from the schema or glossary, and from reviewing existing CWE content). Generally, MITRE prefers submissions at the Base level; however, you might only be aware of a weakness at a lower Variant level.

	d. Scope. Ensure that the submission is within the scope of CWE. When uncertain, you can consult with MITRE about this.

	e. Advanced Notice. Contact the CWE Team at cwe@mitre.org and provide a name and short description of the weakness you would like to submit. This is to avoid time wasted on something that may already exist or is being worked on by someone else.
	

2) Complete the "Submitter's Information" and "New CWE Content Information" sections below.

3) Email your form to cwe@mitre.org.

4) We will work with you to ensure that the information is complete.

5) If the CWE team is considering a significant change to your entry after publication, the team will attempt to contact you to discuss those change requests / modifications before they are released. Modifications that would alter the underlying meaning of the CWE would result in deprecation (and the subsequent creation of a new CWE) enabling the long-term viability of the original CWE.
